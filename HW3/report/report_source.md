# Telecom Churn & CLV Analysis – Concise Summary (Based on Graphs)


## Survival Analysis Findings

The Log-Normal AFT model emerged as the best-performing model, showing the lowest AIC (2963.64) and the highest concordance index (0.779), indicating solid predictive accuracy for customer survival times. Interestingly, none of the model coefficients were statistically significant at the 5% level, meaning no single variable alone had a strong measurable effect on churn. However, the segment-level patterns in CLV and churn probabilities reveal meaningful relationships not captured in the coefficient table. Customers with longer tenure, higher-tier service plans, and more stable characteristics (such as being married or long-term legacy subscribers without internet service) consistently show much higher CLV and lower churn probabilities, implying that these features collectively extend customer lifetime even if individually insignificant.

The CLV analysis shows a highly skewed value distribution. The average CLV is around $24,000, but the median is much lower at $11,392, meaning a small group of customers contributes disproportionately to total value. Plus service customers are the most valuable segment with an average CLV of $38,367, followed by E-service and Total service customers. Basic service customers have the lowest value. A similar pattern appears with internet usage: customers without internet service have nearly three times the CLV of those with internet, likely because many are long-tenured, stable legacy accounts. Based on these observations, a valuable customer can be defined as someone with above-median CLV, a high 12-month survival probability, and a service profile that indicates deeper engagement. Under this definition, Plus service subscribers, married customers, and long-tenured or non-internet legacy users stand out as the highest-value groups.

Using the survival model’s churn risk estimates, 79 customers (7.9% of the base) exceed a 30% churn probability over the next 12 months. Their average CLV is relatively low at about $2,228, leading to a total at-risk CLV of $176,036. Allocating 15% of this amount yields a recommended annual retention budget of approximately **$26,405**, or about $334 per at-risk customer. This budget is appropriate because only a small subset of customers is at meaningful short-term risk, and spending more would not offer proportional returns. Retention efforts should focus on strengthening onboarding for new customers, encouraging upgrades into higher-value service tiers, and maintaining strong engagement among long-tenured users. While these steps will not eliminate churn entirely, they directly address the main risk patterns revealed by the analysis and provide a cost-effective strategy for improving customer lifetime value.
